                <p class="note-result"><strong>Note:</strong> These numbers are only estimates. It is difficult to come up with accurate water-use numbers. The large variety of food-growing and production techniques used worldwide means that the amount of water needed can vary
                    by a huge amount. Another consideration is how far back to go in the chain of production to estimate water use. For beef, some estimates consider only water used for drinking and for maintenance of the animals, while other sources
                    may consider the water needed to grow the food that the cow eats. Keep in mind the limitations and uncertainties in coming up with these estimates.</p>
